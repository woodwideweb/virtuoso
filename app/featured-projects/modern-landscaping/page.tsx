Create retaining wall design, excavate and re-grade construction area to prepare for wall foundation, build terraced retaining walls and flower beds, plant an assortment of deciduous and evergreen trees throughout property, install shrubs and decorative gravel in newly-formed beds surrounding home, perform finish grade and install 2 acres of lawn. Creating an effective plan for the landscaping and erosion control needs for this newly-built custom home presented our crew with a variety of challenges. The foremost concern was how to construct a highly functional retaining wall to address the severe slope along the front of the house while simultaneously complimenting the beautiful modern architecture. Our design team put their heads together to create a stunning yet simple tiered retaining wall system that incorporates both the color and style of the house. Here's how we put our ideas into motion over the course of three months.`,
