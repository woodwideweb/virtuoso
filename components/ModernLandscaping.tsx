    planParagraph={`Creating an effective plan for the landscaping and retention needs for this newly-built custom home presented our crew with a variety of challenges. The foremost concern was how to construct a highly functional retaining wall to address the severe slope along the front of the house while simultaneously complimenting the beautiful modern architecture. Our design team put their heads together to create a stunning yet simple tiered retaining wall system that incorporates both the color and style of the house. Here's how we put our ideas into motion over the course of three months.`}
